# Cellar Run Control

Cellar Run Control is a local Go HTTP service for coordinating a small
production cellar. It keeps formula approval, vessel availability, active
fermentation runs, gravity observations, conditioning, completion metrics, and
vessel cleaning in one deterministic process.

This repository is a healthy initialization baseline. It has no intentional
defects and no automated test suite. Tests are intentionally deferred to a
later engineering task; the production workflow checks in this repository
remain available for immediate build and behavior verification.

## Requirements

- Go 1.23 or later
- A writable local data directory
- No database, network service, or third-party module

## Build And Run

Build every package:

```bash
go build ./...
```

Start the service:

```bash
go run ./cmd/fermentctl serve
```

The default address is `127.0.0.1:8088`. The default snapshot directory is
`./data`.

Environment variables:

- `CELLAR_CONTROL_ADDR`: HTTP listen address.
- `CELLAR_CONTROL_DATA_DIR`: directory containing `state.json`.

Example:

```bash
CELLAR_CONTROL_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9099 \
CELLAR_CONTROL_DATA_DIR=/tmp/cellar-control \
go run ./cmd/fermentctl serve
```

## Public API

Health:

- `GET /healthz`

Formula workflow:

- `POST /v1/formulas`
- `GET /v1/formulas`
- `GET /v1/formulas/{id}`
- `PUT /v1/formulas/{id}/steps`
- `POST /v1/formulas/{id}/approve`
- `POST /v1/formulas/{id}/retire`

Vessel workflow:

- `POST /v1/vessels`
- `GET /v1/vessels`
- `GET /v1/vessels/{id}`
- `POST /v1/vessels/{id}/finish-cleaning`
- `POST /v1/vessels/{id}/retire`

Run workflow:

- `POST /v1/runs`
- `GET /v1/runs`
- `GET /v1/runs/{id}`
- `POST /v1/runs/{id}/reserve`
- `POST /v1/runs/{id}/start`
- `POST /v1/runs/{id}/observations`
- `POST /v1/runs/{id}/conditioning`
- `POST /v1/runs/{id}/complete`
- `POST /v1/runs/{id}/abort`

Audit (read-only):

- `GET /v1/audit-entries`

The audit endpoint returns every recorded successful write as one JSON entry
with a globally increasing `sequence`, the `operation`, the `target_kind`
(`formula`, `vessel`, or `run`) and `target_id`, the aggregate
`version_before` and `version_after`, the UTC `recorded_at` request time, and
a generated `summary`. It supports all combinations of these query
parameters:

- `target_kind` and `target_id`
- `operation` (for example `run.append_observation`)
- `from` and `to` as inclusive RFC3339 timestamps

Results are always returned in sequence order. The endpoint cannot create,
modify, or delete entries.

Writes accept an optional `X-Expected-Version` header. Errors use a stable
shape:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "revision_conflict",
    "detail": "the aggregate version does not match X-Expected-Version",
    "field": ""
  }
}
```

## Workflow Checks

Run each production workflow check separately:

```bash
go run ./cmd/fermentctl check formula-approval
go run ./cmd/fermentctl check vessel-run-lifecycle
go run ./cmd/fermentctl check observations-completion
```

Each check creates a temporary snapshot directory, starts the real HTTP
handler on a loopback listener, issues JSON requests, verifies success and
failure behavior, and removes its temporary data.

## Persistence And Recovery

The service stores a complete revisioned snapshot at
`<data-directory>/state.json`. A write creates a temporary file in the same
directory, commits the encoded bytes durably, closes the handle, and renames
the result over the previous snapshot. The in-memory snapshot is replaced only
after that operation succeeds.

On startup, an existing snapshot is decoded and normalized. Unknown or
conflicting map indexes are not silently invented; invalid JSON or a negative
revision stops the process before HTTP serving begins.

### Audit Log

Every successful business write also appends one JSON line to
`<data-directory>/audit.log`. Each line records the operation, the target
aggregate kind and id, the aggregate versions before and after the write, the
request time, and a result summary. Entries never contain request-supplied
free text (such as run notes or observation notes); summaries hold only
generated identifiers, lifecycle states, versions, and computed numbers.

The append and the business commit are serialized together, and each audit
write is a single locked `write` followed by `fsync`, so concurrent requests
cannot interleave bytes or produce gaps in the sequence. Sequence numbers are
contiguous starting at 1; on startup the file is replayed in order and the
last sequence continues, so both order and target attribution survive
restarts. A malformed file or a gap in the sequence stops startup rather than
truncating history. After a disk write error the log fails closed so a torn
line is never followed by another entry.

Appending to the audit log never changes the outcome of a business write: if
the append fails, the write still returns success and the failure is reported
on the process log instead.

## Repair-Ready Boundaries

The baseline intentionally keeps several independent behavior surfaces visible
for later engineering evaluation:

- formula name normalization and duplicate detection;
- target gravity and process-step range validation;
- aggregate version conflict checks;
- atomic vessel reservation and release;
- run state transition guards;
- observation sequence and time ordering;
- gravity movement and range checks;
- metric calculation and rounding;
- durable snapshot replacement and startup normalization.

These are production mechanisms, not injected defects. A later task can add
automated tests or request a focused repair without changing the public API.

## Test Boundary

This stage does not create unit tests, integration tests, test fixtures, or an
E2E suite. The later test task owns systematic coverage of validation limits,
state transitions, concurrency, persistence failures, and numeric edge cases.

## Scope

The service does not control physical equipment, authenticate remote users,
send notifications, expose a browser interface, or replicate data across
processes. It is intended for a trusted local network or an internal adapter.
